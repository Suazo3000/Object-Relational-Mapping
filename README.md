**The purpose of this project was to create a backend environment that is customizable to e-commerce businesses. This application uses MY SQL, express JS API and sequelize to create a database. With this application the end user has the ability to Get, Delete, Post, and Put within the database. I have learned, how to create a database using MY SQL that works with Express JS API, that will be helpful in a real-world application.
